I want you to generate a single Markdown file (`MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`) that provides a complete, step-by-step guide for migrating this project from Replit to my local machine. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Context:
- Replit is proprietary and uses hidden/personalized dependencies, configs, and environment setups that do not map cleanly to local systems.
- I am an amateur coder. The guide must assume **zero prior knowledge** and provide all necessary details in a clear, foolproof order.
- I will use GeminiCLI (in VSCode) to follow the guide, so the `.md` file should give the AI everything it needs to fully migrate the app without errors.
- The end goal: The app should run **locally on my machine exactly as it runs on Replit**.

üìã The `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` must include:
1. **Project Overview**  
   - Type of project (Node.js, Python, etc.)  
   - Main entry point file  
   - Explanation of Replit-specific configs/files  

2. **Dependency Extraction**  
   - Full list of all dependencies (system-level + language-specific)  
   - Versions (use `poetry.lock`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, or `.replit` where available)  
   - How to recreate the same dependency environment locally  

3. **Environment Setup**  
   - Local OS prerequisites (Node, Python, Java, etc.)  
   - Installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux separately  
   - Environment variables needed (and sample `.env` file if applicable)  

4. **Config & Hidden Files**  
   - Replit files (`.replit`, `replit.nix`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.) explained in detail  
   - Equivalent local setup (how to translate them to `npm`, `venv`, `pip`, or `docker`)  

5. **Migration Steps**  
   - Exact commands to clone/download project from Replit  
   - Commands to set up dependencies locally  
   - Commands to start the app locally  

6. **Testing & Verification**  
   - How to test that everything works the same as in Replit  
   - Troubleshooting common migration errors  

7. **Extra Automation**  
   - Optional: Dockerfile or VSCode DevContainer config for guaranteed reproducibility  

8. **Final Run**  
   - Exact one-liner to launch the app locally once migration is complete  

üìå Output: A single file named `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` with all the above, written in simple but precise language so I (a beginner) can follow it, and detailed enough that GeminiCLI can execute everything automatically.
